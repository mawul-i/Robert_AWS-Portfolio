# EC2 Lab Summary üñ•Ô∏è

In this AWS re/Start lab, I launched and configured an EC2 instance using Amazon Linux. Key steps included:

- Updating the system and installing Apache (httpd)
- Writing a bash script to auto-deploy a web page
- Learning about instance states, public IPs, and security groups
- Practicing automation and cloud-init scripting

This project showcases my ability to provision and manage cloud infrastructure-core skills for any AWS Cloud Practitioner!
