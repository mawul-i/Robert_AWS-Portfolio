# Cloud Security Lifecycle Overview 🔐

Security in the cloud is a shared responsibility between providers and users. This lab focused on the three main stages:

## 🔒 Prevention
- IAM policies to limit access
- Security groups and NACLs for perimeter control
- Encrypted data storage using S3 bucket policies

## 🔍 Detection
- CloudTrail for logging and monitoring actions
- AWS Config for tracking changes to resources
- GuardDuty for threat detection

## 🛠️ Response
- Automated alerts with CloudWatch
- Remediation using Systems Manager Automation
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) enforcement

Understanding these stages ensures proactive risk management across cloud environments.
